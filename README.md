# web-design-challenge
For this challenge I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment. Specifically, I ploted weather data.
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I'll also have a landing page, a page where you can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
Check the website Page on the repository federicocestau.github.io.
